# Custom scorers

In Weave, you can create your own custom [scorers](../scorers/scorers-overview.md). Scorers can be either class-based or function-based. 

:::tip
Python offers a wide range of built-in scorers for common use cases. For more information, see [Select a built-in scorer](../scorers/built-in-scorers.md#select-a-built-in-scorer) on the [built-in scorers page](../scorers/built-in-scorers.md).
:::

## Select the right type of custom scorer

Choosing the right type of custom scorer depends on the your scenario complexity and requirements:

- [Function-based scorers](#function-based-scorers): Use if your evaluation logic is simple and can be implemented in a single function. Examples include checking if text is uppercase, validating specific conditions, or applying straightforward transformations. **Function-based scorers are available in both Python and TypeScript.**

- [Class-based scorers](#class-based-scorers): Use if your evaluation requires advanced logic, maintaining metadata, or multiple steps. Examples include keeping track of additional scorer metadata, trying different prompts for your LLM-evaluators, and making multiple function calls. **Class-based scorers are only available in Python.**

## Function-based scorers

Function-based scorers are available in both Python and TypeScript.

     Function-based scorers in Python are functions decorated with `@weave.op` that return a dictionary. 
     
     ### How to create a function-based scorer
     
     To create a function-based scorer, define a function that meets the following criteria:
     - Is decorated with `@weave.op`.
     - Returns a dictionary.

     #### Example
     The following example shows `evaluate_uppercase`, which checks if the text is uppercase:

    ```python
    import weave

    @weave.op
    def evaluate_uppercase(text: str) -> dict:
        return {"text_is_uppercase": text.isupper()}

    my_eval = weave.Evaluation(
        dataset=[{"text": "HELLO WORLD"}],
        scorers=[evaluate_uppercase]
    )
    ```

    Function-based scorers in TypeScript are functions wrapped with `weave.op` that accept an object with `modelOutput` and optionally `datasetRow`. 
    
    ### How to create a function-based scorer
     
     To create a function-based scorer, define a function that:
     - Is decorated with `@weave.op`.
     - Accepts `modelOutput`

     Optionally, the function can accept a `datasetRow`.

     #### Example
     The following example shows `evaluate_uppercase`, which checks if the text is uppercase:

    ```typescript
    import * as weave from 'weave'

    const evaluateUppercase = weave.op(
        ({modelOutput}) => modelOutput.toUpperCase() === modelOutput,
        {name: 'textIsUppercase'}
    );


    const myEval = new weave.Evaluation({
        dataset: [{text: 'HELLO WORLD'}],
        scorers: [evaluateUppercase],
    })
    ```

## Class-based scorers

:::note
This feature is not available in TypeScript. All usage instructions and code examples in this section are for Python.
:::

Class-based scorers are useful for more advanced evaluations. Class-based scorers inherit from  the `Scorer` class. 

#### How to create a class-based scorer

To create a class-based scorer, create a Python class that:

1. Inherits from `weave.Scorer`.
2. Defines a `score` method that:
   - Is decorated with `@weave.op`.
   - Returns a dictionary.

#### Example

The following example shows a class-based scorer called `SummarizationScorer`. This class-based scorer uses `gpt-4o` to evaluate the quality of a summary by comparing it to the original text..

```python
import weave
from openai import OpenAI
from weave import Scorer

llm_client = OpenAI()

class SummarizationScorer(Scorer):
    model_id: str = "gpt-4o"
    system_prompt: str = "Evaluate whether the summary is good."

    @weave.op
    def some_complicated_preprocessing(self, text: str) -> str:
        processed_text = "Original text: \n" + text + "\n"
        return processed_text

    @weave.op
    def call_llm(self, summary: str, processed_text: str) -> dict:
        res = llm_client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": (
                    f"Analyze how good the summary is compared to the original text."
                    f"Summary: {summary}\n{processed_text}"
                )}])
        return {"summary_quality": res}

    @weave.op
    def score(self, output: str, text: str) -> dict:
        """Score the summary quality.

        Args:
            output: The summary generated by an AI system
            text: The original text being summarized
        """
        processed_text = self.some_complicated_preprocessing(text)
        eval_result = self.call_llm(summary=output, processed_text=processed_text)
        return {"summary_quality": eval_result}

evaluation = weave.Evaluation(
    dataset=[{"text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."}],
    scorers=[summarization_scorer])
```
