      an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some
      tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed,
      you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation
      can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use
      the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation
      will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen
      you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation:
      \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\":
      {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task,
      use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way
      to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output
      should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\":
      {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples
      using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in
      this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\":

      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\":
      {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation:
      \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\":
      \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation:
      5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\":
      {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\":

      web search based on your query (think a Google search) then returns the top
      search results.\n    Takes inputs: {''query'': {''type'': ''string'', ''description'':
      ''The search query to perform.''}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n-
      final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs:
      {''answer'': {''type'': ''any'', ''description'': ''The final answer to the
      problem''}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should
      always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will
      fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names
      as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed:
      do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the
      task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your
      answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same
      parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"New
