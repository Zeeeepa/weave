      ## context ## ]]\\n[1] \xABDavid Gregory (physician) | David Gregory (20 December
      1625 \u2013 1720) was a Scottish physician and inventor. His surname is sometimes
      spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle
      in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He
      is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as
      \\\"being destructive to the human species\\\". Copies and details of the model
      no longer exist. Gregory's use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather
      conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from
      Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.\xBB\\n[2] \xABGregory Tarchaneiotes

      \u03A4\u03B1\u03C1\u03C7\u03B1\u03BD\u03B5\u03B9\u03CE\u03C4\u03B7\u03C2 , Italian:
      \\\"Gregorio Tracanioto\\\" or \\\"Tracamoto\\\" ) was a \\\"protospatharius\\\"
      and the long-reigning catepan of Italy from 998 to 1006. In December 999, and
      again on February 2, 1002, he reinstituted and confirmed the possessions of
      the abbey and monks of Monte Cassino in Ascoli. In 1004, he fortified and expanded
      the castle of Dragonara on the Fortore. He gave it three circular towers and
      one square one. He also strengthened Lucera.\xBB\\n[3] \xABGregory of Gaeta
      | Gregory was the Duke of Gaeta from 963 until his death. He was the second
      son of Docibilis II of Gaeta and his wife Orania. He succeeded his brother John
      II, who had left only daughters. Gregory rapidly depleted the \\\"publicum\\\"
      (public land) of the Duchy of Gaeta by doling it out to family members as grants.
      Gregory disappears from the records in 964 and was succeeded by his younger
      brother Marinus of Fondi over the heads of his three sons. It is possible that
      there was an internal power struggle between factions of the Docibilan family
      and that Gregory was forced out. On the other hand, perhaps he died and his
      sons fought a losing battle for their inheritance to Gaeta.\xBB\\n\\n[[ ## question
