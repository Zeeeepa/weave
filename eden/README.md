# Eden

## The Problem
Working with Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers today presents several challenges for developers and organizations:

1. **Fragmented Access**: Developers must manage connections to multiple MCP servers individually, each with their own authentication, configuration, and monitoring requirements.

2. **Deployment Complexity**: There's no standardized way to deploy and run MCP servers. Teams must choose between various approaches (remote servers, containers, local scripts) without clear guidance or tooling.

3. **Limited Discovery**: Finding reliable and secure MCP servers is difficult. There's no central place to discover, verify, and share MCP server implementations.

4. **Debugging Challenges**: When issues arise, developers lack proper tools to inspect, debug, and monitor MCP server behavior.

5. **Visibility Gaps**: Organizations struggle to maintain visibility into MCP server usage, performance, and errors across their infrastructure.

## Our Vision
Eden aims to be the unified platform for working with MCP servers. We envision a world where:

- Developers can seamlessly work with multiple MCP servers through a single interface
- Teams can easily deploy, manage, and monitor their MCP infrastructure
- Organizations can discover and verify reliable MCP servers
- Everyone has the tools they need to debug and optimize their MCP workflows

## System Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. Server Aggregator
The heart of Eden is a central server that unifies access to multiple MCP servers. Think of it as a smart reverse proxy that:
- Provides a single entry point to all your MCP servers
- Maintains isolated namespaces for each server's tools and resources
- Handles authentication and access control
- Enables human-in-the-loop approvals for sensitive operations
- Offers configurable rate limits and quotas

#### 2. Server Execution Framework
Eden supports multiple ways to run MCP servers:
- Connect to existing remote MCP servers
- Run servers in Docker containers
- Execute standalone Python scripts
- Develop and test servers locally

This flexibility allows teams to choose the right approach for their needs while maintaining consistent management and monitoring.

#### 3. Server Registry
A community hub for discovering and sharing MCP servers:
- Browse verified and community-tested servers
- Access documentation and usage examples
- Share your own server implementations
- Get notified of updates and security patches

#### 4. Development Environment
Tools designed for the developer workflow:
- Interactive playground for testing and experimentation
- Real-time debugging and inspection
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Documentation generation and sharing

### How It All Works Together

1. **Getting Started**
   - Browse the registry to find MCP servers you need
   - Deploy servers using your preferred method
   - Connect them to your Eden instance

2. **Daily Development**
   - Use the unified interface to interact with all your servers
   - Debug issues with the inspector
   - Experiment with new ideas in the playground
   - Share your work with the community

3. **Production Operations**
   - Monitor server health and performance
   - Manage access and approvals
   - Track usage and optimize resources
   - Stay updated with security patches
